# OnlineStoreApp

As part of my Senior Capstone project at Grand Canyon University, I developed an online store application with the goal of transforming the e-commerce market by giving customers a simple and easy way to shop. The principal aim of the project was developing an intuitive platform that facilitates consumers' perusal, acquisition, and administration of an extensive array of items from many vendors, all inside a safe virtual environment. I used a range of tools and technologies to realize this idea by utilizing my software development expertise. Important tools used in the process of development are:
Database: SQL programming for Microsoft 
Software: Ignition for Inductive Automation
Design: To create UI sketches and flowcharts, use Draw.io.

Using these technologies and following software engineering best practices, I was able to create an Online Store application that satisfies modern consumer needs while also conforming to moral standards and Christian beliefs.

Below I've included a few UI Screenshots of my application.
