# OnlineStoreApp

As part of my Senior Capstone project at Grand Canyon University, I developed an online store application with the goal of transforming the e-commerce market by giving customers a simple and easy way to shop. I used a range of tools and technologies to realize this idea by utilizing my software development expertise. Important tools used in the process of development are:

Database: SQL programming for Microsoft 

Software: Inductive Automation's Ignition Platform

Design: UI sketches and flowcharts were built utilizing Draw.io.

Using these technologies and following software engineering best practices, I was able to create an Online Store application that satisfies modern consumer needs while also conforming to moral standards and Christian beliefs.

Below I've included a few user interface screenshots of my application.
